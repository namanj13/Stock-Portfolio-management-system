# ðŸ“ˆ StockManager: Stock Portfolio Management System

**StockManager** is a Spring Boot-based RESTful API that enables users to manage their stock market portfolio through full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. It integrates real-time data validation and optimized querying using GraphQL and web scraping via JSoup.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies & Tools

- **Java** â€” Core language for application logic.
- **Spring Boot** â€” Framework for building RESTful APIs quickly and efficiently.
- **JPA Repository** â€” Simplifies database interaction and data persistence.
- **REST API** â€” Enables structured and scalable data operations.
- **GraphQL** â€” Used for precise, memory-efficient data querying.
- **JSoup** â€” HTML parser for validating stock entries via web scraping.

## ðŸ“š Key Features

- **Portfolio Management via REST API**  
  Perform essential operations using standard HTTP methods:
  - `GET` â€” Retrieve stock data
  - `POST` â€” Add new stock to the portfolio
  - `PUT` â€” Update stock details
  - `DELETE` â€” Remove stock from the portfolio

- **Efficient Data Queries using GraphQL**  
  Query only required fields to reduce data load and memory consumption compared to traditional SQL queries.

- **Real-Time Stock Validation with JSoup**  
  - Ensures only valid stocks are added to the portfolio.
  - Scrapes live data from a stock market website to verify the stock symbol.
  - Invalid or delisted stocks are automatically excluded during creation or updates.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project locally:

1. **Open the project** in your preferred IDE (IntelliJ / Eclipse).
2. **Run the application** as a Spring Boot project.
3. **Use Postman** (or any API testing tool) to interact with the endpoints:
   - Choose the correct HTTP method (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`).
   - Use JSON format for request bodies in `POST` and `PUT` methods.
4. **To make GraphQL queries**:
   - Use Postman's GraphQL tab or any GraphQL client.
   - Ensure the query syntax is correct and targets only necessary fields.

ðŸ“Œ **Note**: Ensure your local server is running before sending any API requests.
